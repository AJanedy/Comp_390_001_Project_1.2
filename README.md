This program does import StringIO from io as a workaround for issues using readouterr, will 
fix this if time allows

This program reads in a file of meteorite landings, takes in user input to suggest how the
data in the file is to be filtered, then creates a formatted list to be displayed to the user, 
or a text file, or an Excel file


After starting the program, follow the prompts exactly:

The program will display a list of files available.

Select one of those files by typing the name of it into the given prompt

Then select the method for which you would like to open that file ('r' or "open for reading"
is recommended here).

Then select which attribute you would like to filter the data on

Depending on the chosen attribute, then select the range for which you would like to filter the data

Then select how you would like that data formatted to be given back to the 
user (terminal, .txt, or .xls)
